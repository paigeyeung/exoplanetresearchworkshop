## The Workshop

The Exoplanet Research Workshop is a group-run project intended to bring the [astronomy research seminar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23212207G/abstract){:target="_blank"} experience to a larger population of pre-college students across the globe. Workshop participants contribute research findings to [NASA's Exoplanet Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/), a citizen science initiative.

We've shared our workshop experiences and citizen science research with the larger space science, citizen science, and science education community at conferences including the [AAVSO Annual Meeting](https://www.aavso.org/aavso-meetings), the [Global Hands-On Universe Conference](https://handsonuniverse.org/ghou2020/){:target="_blank"} (recording [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=949654105549090&t=1720){:target="_blank"}), and the [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting). We will later be conducting a meta-study on this workshop and our cumulative findings.

## Getting Involved

For those who are just getting started with contributing to Exoplanet Watch, we've posted resources in [Getting Started](/getting-started/). We've posted several of our [meeting recordings and slides](/meetings/) in case you would like to review them.

In our workshop iterations, we first hold large weekly group meetings in Zoom and later switch over to smaller group meetings for individual teams to focus on their research.
