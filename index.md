## Latest Update (May 11, 2022)

Congratulations to teams that have published!

<!-- Team applications are open! Find the application [here](https://forms.gle/y5aV4qgNoLksj8so8){:target="_blank"}. You are welcome to join as a casual volunteer, too; just specify if you're interested.

Paige will be presenting at the 110th AAVSO Fall Meeting in person at The Row Hotel in Somerville, MA,  occurring November 6-7, 2021. You can register by following the instructions [here](https://www.aavso.org/110-annual-meeting){:target="_blank"}. We would recommend that you get sponsored by your school/institution to attend if you're interested, as there are registration costs. -->

We are currently taking a break from the workshop and will be running another iteration in summer 2022. If you would like to get started, you can view our meeting recordings for the Exoplanet Research Workshop [here](/meetings/). See our [Getting Started](/getting-started/) page for more detailed instructions on how to proceed.

Here are the links to the working versions of the [transit analyzer](http://exoplanetresearch.netlify.app/transitanalyzer){:target="_blank"} and the [transit submission form](http://exoplanetresearch.netlify.app/transitsubmission){:target="_blank"}. We've posted the paper guidelines [here](/papers/). When you have completed your draft, it will be reviewed by your point person and Kalee (in that order) before it is sent to astronomers. The first paper from this workshop has been submitted to the Journal of the AAVSO!

Please feel free to reach out to [Paige](/contact/) for any guidance you need. We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups.

## The Workshop

The Exoplanet Research Workshop is a group-run project intended to bring the [astronomy research seminar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23212207G/abstract){:target="_blank"} experience to a larger population of pre-college students across the globe. Workshop participants contribute research findings to [NASA's Exoplanet Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/), a citizen science initiative.

We've shared our workshop experiences and citizen science research with the larger space science, citizen science, and science education community at conferences including the [Global Hands-On Universe Conference](https://handsonuniverse.org/ghou2020/){:target="_blank"} (recording [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=949654105549090&t=1720){:target="_blank"}) and the [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting). We will later be conducting a meta-study on this workshop and our cumulative findings.

## Getting Involved

For those who are just getting started with contributing to Exoplanet Watch, we've posted resources in [Getting Started](/getting-started/). We've posted several of our [meeting recordings and slides](/meetings/) in case you would like to review them.

In our workshop iterations, we first hold large weekly group meetings in Zoom and later switch over to smaller group meetings for individual teams to focus on their research.
