## Literature Review

The following are papers your team should read if you are writing a paper. You can split them up among your teammates or each read all of them. If you're interested, you can search for more papers on your own.
* **Existing Qatar-1 b literature:** [Transit Timing Variation Measurements of WASP-12b and Qatar-1b: No Evidence for Additional Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00464){:target="_blank"}
* **Instrumentation:** [MicroObservatory Net: A Network of Automated Remote Telescopes Dedicated to Educational Use](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1023/A:1016668526933?shared_access_token=AVqtxlUonur3ODVcIH76AospNOxuUNtyllpwxVxrbfDHew4OVeU1SHRgW8tfuvC4Bzcd5ItGjpVRgFi-KQ36WeBAnriIeORBolFOz4QClHqQYsUDPSCd_oQpL2PTCfDo8bFOSyTRPM9RkT0bgJlX_p0tJd7-kjcLmbgZAk0zL4M%3D){:target="_blank"}
