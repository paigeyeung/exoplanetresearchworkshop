## Literature Review

The following are papers your team should read if you are writing a paper. You can split them up among your teammates or each read all of them. If you're interested, you can search for more papers on your own.
* **Existing Qatar-1 b literature:** [Transit Timing Variation Measurements of WASP-12b and Qatar-1b: No Evidence for Additional Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00464){:target="_blank"}
* **Instrumentation:** [MicroObservatory Net: A Network of Automated Remote Telescopes Dedicated to Educational Use](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1023/A:1016668526933?shared_access_token=AVqtxlUonur3ODVcIH76AospNOxuUNtyllpwxVxrbfDHew4OVeU1SHRgW8tfuvC4Bzcd5ItGjpVRgFi-KQ36WeBAnriIeORBolFOz4QClHqQYsUDPSCd_oQpL2PTCfDo8bFOSyTRPM9RkT0bgJlX_p0tJd7-kjcLmbgZAk0zL4M%3D){:target="_blank"}
* **Astronomy with small telescopes:** [Utilizing Small Telescopes Operated by Citizen Scientists for Transiting Exoplanet Follow-up](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132e4401Z/abstract){:target="_blank"}

We encourage you to check out some of the papers in the [*Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers* (*JAAVSO*)](https://www.aavso.org/apps/jaavso/){:target="_blank"} or [*Astronomy Theory, Observations and Methods* (*ATOM*)](https://rtsre.org/index.php/atom). You will likely be publishing in one of the two aforementioned journals.

## The Feedback Process

Whenever you have a draft ready for review, your point person will read and provide feedback on your paper. Next, Kalee will do the same. After the aforementioned feedback process and before you publish, your point person will help you find astronomers to review your paper.
