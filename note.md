# Note from Paige

Hi all,

I have enjoyed running the Exoplanet Research Workshop and I will still be working on this in the future, but this project may be taking on a different form in future years. I have other goals for this project that I would like to focus on.

* Spreading awareness of citizen science, which can take many forms
* Making this site a better resource for people who want to get started on exoplanet research independently (and then of course join groups like NASA's Exoplanet Watch for guidance and support)

I would encourage all students interested in exoplanet research to join [Exoplanet Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/overview/); their Slack workspace can be found [here](https://join.slack.com/t/uol-ets/shared_invite/zt-mvb4ljbo-LRBgpk3uMmUokbs4ge2JlA). The team at Exoplanet Watch has graciously supported our workshop these past few years, and this workshop would not have been possible without their expertise and guidance.

For students: many subfields of the earth and space sciences (and of other some other fields like data science and computer science) are comparatively very accessible to the public, and thus, they can be great fields for someone looking to get started with scientific research. Professional-amateur communities are a good resource. Some of these are online communities, like Exoplanet Watch. You may find similar organizations in your local community as well; in my experience, I've seen that many such citizen science organizations work on issues related to conservation and the environment.

Best,

Paige
