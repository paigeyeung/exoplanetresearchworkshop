# Note from Paige

Hi all,

I have enjoyed running the Exoplanet Research Workshop, but I am unsure if I will be actively running it in this workshop form past our third iteration, taking place this year. I will still be working on this, but I have other goals for this project that I would like to focus on.

* Spreading awareness of citizen science, which can take many forms
* Making this site a better resource for people who want to get started on exoplanet research independently (and then of course join groups like NASA's Exoplanet Watch for guidance and support)
