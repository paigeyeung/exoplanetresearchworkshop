# Getting Started

## Imaging Software

We would recommend using AstroImageJ, but feel free to use another astronomical imaging software. AIJ is tricky with Catalina, so if you are running Catalina, SAOImage DS9 may work better.

The download links are below.

* [SAOImage DS9](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Download.html)

You can find text instructions for using AstroImageJ [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wN5WhPDCFvLuUglR9uC-6S_c7tDQUbYdOmVoD4NUQ1c/edit).
